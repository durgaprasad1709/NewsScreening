This episode highlighted SNC-Lavalin's corruption issues, resulting in executive dismissals and arrests. Years later, SNC-Lavalin's dealings in Libya became central to a political scandal involving Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Allegations surfaced that Trudeau or his aides pressured former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to settle the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bribery charges in Libya, leading to her resignation and an ethics investigation into Trudeau's actions."
